# What is Agile?

Agile is a set of values and principles.

Agile is a collection of beliefs that teams can use for making decisions about how to do the work of developing software.

# How does a team become Agile?

They make decisions based on the principles and values that the team has decided to follow (i.e. Agile values and principles).

Agile's real utility is giving people a common foundation for making decisions about the best way to develop software.

You should look for practices that support the Agile principles and values.

# Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

# 12 Principles of Agile

The Manifesto for Agile Software Development is based on twelve principles. They're about giving you the ability to make a good decision.

1. Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
3. Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months).
4. Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers.
5. Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted.
6. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location).
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.
10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.
11. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly.
